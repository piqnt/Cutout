Cutout
======

Cutout (as in cutout animation) is a minimal but functionally complete JavaScript library for playing image cutouts in a HTML5 Canvas.

It was originally started by extending DisplayFramework and latter reorganized to support new features.

Cutout is not a physics or game engine, but it can be used for developing natively-optimized games.
