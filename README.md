Cutout
======

Cutout (as in cutout animation) is a minimal but functionally complete JavaScript library for making sprite sheet games and visual apps in HTML5 Canvas.
Cutout is not a physics or full-fledged game engine, it only provides UI functionalities.

Cutout was originally started by extending [DisplayFramework](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-fast-canvas/blob/master/Android/assets/www/DisplayFramework.js) and latter reorganized to support new features.
